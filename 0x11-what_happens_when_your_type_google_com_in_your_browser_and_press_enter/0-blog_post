- Introduction

The internet, in it's most basic form, is a global network of interconnected computers communicating with each other.
The idea of the internet started in the 1960s as an attempt to connect computers over a network to share resources, with the possibility of expanding it to a wide area network(WAN).
This led to the development of what would be the first functional version of the internet, ARPANET, in the late 1960s and the idea behind it was absolutely genius.
Data shared digitally over this network was grouped into tiny blocks called packets. These packets would contain an header and a payload.
The header would contain the source and destination IP addresses, sequence numbers and other valuable resources used by networking devices to send information(the payload) over the network.
Think of IP addresses to computers as home addresses are to homes. IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network.
Such a network is commonly known as a packet-switched network.
Over the coming years, more packet-switched networks arose due to the potency of the research.
This time, researchers were looking into connecting such packet-switched networks with other networks.
This ushered in some rules called protocols designed to dictate how data should be packaged(into packets), transmitted and received by computers over a network despite the difference in system architecture.
In the late 1970s, public networks became a thing and since then, the internet has gone through explosive growth.
That's it folks! Yes, the internet is just a big packet-switched network based on some rules called protocols.
But what really happens under the hood, how does my browser know where to get the information I want? How does this information end up on my computer and not on a different one?
There's a rather simple architecture behind how we use the internet today. We have computers accessing the information through a browser(a client) and computers serving the resources(servers).
Let's have a look at what happens when I type `https://www.google.com` in my browser and press Enter.

- DNS request


- TCP/IP
- Firewall
- HTTPS/SSL
- Load-balancer
- Web server
- Application server
- Database
